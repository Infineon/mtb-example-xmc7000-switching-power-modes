## Overview

This code example shows how to transition the MCU to Active, Sleep, and DeepSleep power states. After transitioning to Sleep, DeepSleep, or Hibernate power state, the example also shows how to wake up and return to Active state.

The project uses a kit button to change the power state. Figure 1 shows the state machine implemented in the firmware to execute the transitions.

**Figure 1. Power modes state machine**

The project also uses an LED to indicate the selected power state. Table 1 shows the state of the LED for each mode.

**Table 1. LED states in various power states**

| **Power/MCU states** | **LED state** |
|-------------------------|---------------|
| Active | Blinks |
| Sleep | Turned ON and dimmed |
| DeepSleep | Turned OFF |
| Hibernate | Turned OFF |

The 'project-creator-cli' tool can be used to create applications from a CLI terminal or from within batch files or shell scripts. This tool is available in the *{ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/tools_{version}/project-creator/* directory.

Use a CLI terminal to invoke the 'project-creator-cli' tool. On Windows, use the command-line 'modus-shell' program provided in the ModusToolbox&trade; installation instead of a standard Windows command-line application. This shell provides access to all ModusToolbox&trade; tools. You can access it by typing "modus-shell" in the search box in the Windows menu. In Linux and macOS, you can use any terminal application.

The following example clones the "[XMC7000 MCU: Switching between power modes](https://github.com/Infineon/mtb-example-xmc7000-switching-power-modes)" application with the desired name "MyPowerModes" configured for the *KIT_XMC72_EVK* BSP into the specified working directory, *C:/mtb_projects*:

   ```
   project-creator-cli --board-id KIT_XMC72_EVK --app-id mtb-example-xmc7000-switching-power-modes --user-app-name MyPowerModes --target-dir "C:/mtb_projects"
   ```

<mark>Update the above paragraph and commands to match your CE.

The 'project-creator-cli' tool has the following arguments:

Argument | Description | Required/optional
---------|-------------|-----------
`--board-id` | Defined in the <id> field of the [BSP](https://github.com/Infineon?q=bsp-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--app-id`   | Defined in the <id> field of the [CE](https://github.com/Infineon?q=ce-manifest&type=&language=&sort=) manifest | Required
`--target-dir`| Specify the directory in which the application is to be created if you prefer not to use the default current working directory | Optional
`--user-app-name`| Specify the name of the application if you prefer to have a name other than the example's default name | Optional

> **Note:** The project-creator-cli tool uses the `git clone` and `make getlibs` commands to fetch the repository and import the required libraries. For details, see the "Project creator tools" section of the [ModusToolbox&trade; tools package user guide](https://www.infineon.com/ModusToolboxUserGuide) (locally available at {ModusToolbox&trade; install directory}/docs_{version}/mtb_user_guide.pdf).

## Operation

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.

3. Program the board using one of the following:

   <details><summary><b>Using Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

      1. Select the application project in the Project Explorer.

      2. In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **\<Application Name> Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>In other IDEs</b></summary>

   Follow the instructions in your preferred IDE.
   </details>


   <details><summary><b>Using CLI</b></summary>

     From the terminal, execute the `make program` command to build and program the application using the default toolchain to the default target. The default toolchain is specified in the application's Makefile but you can override this value manually:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=<toolchain>
      ```

      Example:
      ```
      make program TOOLCHAIN=GCC_ARM
      ```
   </details>

4. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that kit LED blinks at 3 Hz (approximately). Take note of the current consumption. The device is in the Active state at this moment.

5. Quickly press the kit button to transition the device into Sleep power state. Observe that the LED is ON and dimmed. Confirm that the current consumption drops to dozens of milliamperes. The CPU is in the Sleep state at this moment.

6. Quickly press the kit button to return to Active state. Observe that the LED blinks again.

7. Press the kit button for approximately one second and release it. Observe that the LED is OFF and that the current consumption has dropped to over a hundred microamperes. The device is in DeepSleep state at this moment.

8. Quickly press the kit button to return to Active power state. Observe that the LED blinks again and that the current consumption has increased to the same level measured before.

9. Press the kit button for at least two seconds and release it. Observe that the LED is OFF and that the current consumption has dropped to approximately ten microamperes. The device is in Hibernate state at this moment. After steps 4 - 9, the terminal application displays the message as follows:

    **Figure 2. Terminal output**

    ![](images/terminal_output.png)

10. Quickly press the kit button to wake up from Hibernate power state, and then MCU reset. Observe that the LED is blinking again. When woken up from Hibernate mode, the terminal application displays the message as follows:

    **Figure 3. Hibernate wakeup terminal output**

    ![](images/hibernate_wakeup_terminal_output.png)


## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code.


<details><summary><b>In Eclipse IDE</b></summary>

Use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox&trade; user guide](https://www.infineon.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).


> **Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the debugging CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice – once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.infineon.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.

## Design and implementation

This example configures the PWM to blink, dim, and turn ON/OFF the LED. The firmware implements the state machine shown in the [Overview](#overview) section and controls the duty cycle of the PWM block. The device wakes up when a switch press is detected.

Power management callback functions are registered as PWM callbacks. Table 2 shows the actions of callback function for every power state. For more information on power callbacks, see the HAL driver - System Power Management.

**Table 2. Transition actions**

| Callback | Power state | CHECK_READY | CHECK_FAIL | BEFORE_TRANSITION | AFTER_TRANSITION |
|---|---| ---| --- | --- | --- |
| PWM callback | Sleep | Nothing | Nothing | Dim the LED. | Blink the LED. |
| PWM callback | DeepSleep | Nothing | Nothing | Stop PWM | Re-enable the PWM block. Blink the LED. |
| PWM callback | Hibernate | Nothing | Nothing | Stop PWM | Nothing |
